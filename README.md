This code works for all base inputs as mentioned in the question.
Code can also be extended to advanced inputs as well.

A mapping_dictionary is used to map a spoken digit english word to written word.
As of know mapping_dictionary consists of few alphabets,few numbers etc.

All possible inputs can be added to mapping_dictionary.
Finally all words in the input are looked up in mapping_dictionary and can be converted accordingly.

Few more conditional statements I have missed.
If we add those also,then this code will be more usable.

# Instructions to run the code:
--------------------------------
Just give the possible inputs to inputs variable in list format.
Respective outputs will be generated.
